	<h3>The Short Version</h3>
	<p>At FollowBack we care about your privacy. We do not sell or rent your personal information to third parties. We do not disclose it to others except as required to provide you with the services of the FollowBack.mobi website ("Site"), meaning - to allow you to buy, sell, share the information you want to share on the Site, pay for products, post reviews and so on.</p>
	<p>We collect information that you provide us or voluntarily share with other users, and also some general technical information that is automatically gathered by our systems, such as IP address, browser information and cookies to enable you to have a better user experience and a more personalized browsing experience.</p>
	<p>Information that you provide us in the process of the registration will remain private and secure - including your contact information.</p>
	<p>Information that you choose to publish on the site (photos, videos, text, music, reviews, deliveries) - is no longer private, just like any information you publish online.</p>
	<p>Technical information that is gathered by our systems, or third party systems, automatically may be used for Site operation, optimization, analytics, content promotion and enhancement of user experience. We may use your information to contact you - to provide notices related to your activities, or offer you promotions and general updates, but we will not let any other person, including sellers and buyers, contact you, other than through your user login.</p>
	<p>The above are just the highlights. We encourage you to read more about information we collect, how we use it, understand what is the meaning of cookie (no, you can't eat it) and more in the long and boring version of our privacy policy below.</p>
