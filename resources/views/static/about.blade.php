			<h2 class="header">Here's how Followback Works</h2>
				<ol class="list-circles">
				<li><span>1</span> Sign up, it’s free!</li>

				<li><span>2</span> Pick a user you want a social media task done by.</li>

				<li><span>3</span> After you find the user you're looking for, choose what type of social media task you want completed. You have five options to choose from: Followback, Like, Post Media, Post Text or Comment On.</li>

				<li><span>4</span> After picking the type of social media task you want fulfilled, consider how much are you willing to pay the user to complete the social task. Currently, our method of payment is Paypal but will be adding other methods of payment soon. </li>
				
				<li><span>5</span> Finally, fill-in the instructions needed for the social media task to be done. For example, if you're choosing to have someone follow you back, add the username and social media platform you want them to follow you on.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>All charges are pre-authorizations and your account will only be charged if your social task is accepted. In some cases, the pre-authorization can expire or become invalid due to insufficient funds.The minimum offer allowed for any social task is $5. If, for whatever reason, the social task is not fulfilled for the 30 day minimum, you will be issued a refund. Please keep in mind that there is a $0.30 non-deductible Paypal fee for all refunds.</p>
