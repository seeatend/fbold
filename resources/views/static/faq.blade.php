	<strong>How Follow Back works</strong>
	<ol>
		<li>Login using either your Instagram, Twitter or Facebook accounts. Connect more accounts here.</li>
		<li>Search through the desired social media platform to find and select the user you want to interact with.</li>
		<li>Here you can send a bid for that user to follow back, like, post, repost, comment, promote location, accept follow request.</li>
		<li>Upon sending your bid, you will be redirected to paypal for preauthorization. You will only be charged if the user accepts your bid.</li>
	</ol>


	<strong>How Payments work</strong>
	<p>Users are obligated to perform service for 30 days minimum. After which we are not responsible, and refunds will not be valid.</p>
	<p>For 'pay now' it's simple, your Paypal account gets charged immediately per service task.</p>
	<p>In the case of a bid placed on FollowBack, Paypal immediately preauthorizes the transaction. We do not charge the buyer's account until the user accepts your bid. Preauthorization can last a minimum of 3 days, and could exceed 30 days. Once the bid is accepted, the funds are issued to the sellers account with 6-12 hours.</p>
