For that reason, businesses, brands, and individuals are willing to pay others to interact with their online content. For example, let’s say your brand is releasing a new line of sneakers. To help create buzz and gain more exposure for the launch, you can pay a person on social media with a large number of followers to like one of your posts on social media.
